Prime Prediction and RSA Key Generation Experiment
Overview
This project implements a unified experimental framework for prime number prediction and RSA key generation using a hybrid model. The approach combines several techniques:

Prime Generation: Standard generation of prime numbers within a specified range.
Fractal Interpolation and Parameter Fitting: Modeling the global trend of prime distribution with a fractal function.
Error Correction using Machine Learning: Correction of residual errors using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
Dynamic Weight Optimization: Optimization of ensemble model weights on segmented data.
Extreme Error Correction: Smoothing out outliers by replacing extreme errors with neighbor averages.
Ultra-High Range Tests: Evaluation of the method‚Äôs scalability in very large numeric ranges.
Execution Time Analysis: Measurement of computational efficiency over different range sizes.
Sensitivity Analysis of Hyperparameters: Analysis of how changes in hyperparameters affect model performance.
Experimental Comparison with Deep Learning Models: Comparison with LSTM and Transformer models.
Practical Cryptographic Application: RSA key generation using primes generated by the model.
All functionalities are integrated into a single Python script, prime_prediction_full.py, and additional files (e.g., plots such as transformer.png, LSTM.png, execution_time.png, number_of_trees.png) are provided to support the analyses.
