Prime Prediction and RSA Key Generation Experiment
Overview
This project implements a unified experimental framework for prime number prediction and RSA key generation using a hybrid model. The approach combines:

Prime Generation: Standard generation of prime numbers within a specified range.
Fractal Interpolation and Parameter Fitting: Modeling the global trend of prime distribution with a fractal function.
Error Correction using Machine Learning: Correction of residual errors using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
Dynamic Weight Optimization: Optimization of ensemble model weights on segmented data.
Extreme Error Correction: Smoothing out outliers by replacing extreme errors with neighbor averages.
Ultra-High Range Tests: Evaluation of the methodâ€™s scalability in very large numeric ranges.
Execution Time Analysis: Measurement of computational efficiency over different range sizes.
Sensitivity Analysis of Hyperparameters: Analysis of how changes in hyperparameters affect model performance.
Experimental Comparison with Deep Learning Models: Comparison with LSTM and Transformer models.
Practical Cryptographic Application: RSA key generation using primes generated by the model.
This unified framework is implemented in a single Python script and is designed to be fully reproducible.

Detailed Code Description
1. Prime Generation
Generates a list of prime numbers within a given range using a simple list comprehension and the isprime function from Sympy.

2. Fractal Interpolation and Parameter Fitting
fractal_prime_model_safe: Defines the fractal model function.
fit_fractal_prime_model_safe: Fits the model to primes from a specified range using multiple initial guesses to avoid local minima.
generate_fractal_primes: Uses the fitted model to predict prime numbers.
3. Data Preparation for LSTM/Transformer
prepare_lstm_data: Prepares sequential data from the error series for deep learning models.
4. Machine Learning Error Correction (RF and GB)
Trains Random Forest and Gradient Boosting regressors to predict the residual error between the true primes and the fractal model predictions.

5. Dynamic Weight Optimization
Optimizes the weights of the RF and GB models in segments using a regularized mean squared error loss to improve overall prediction.

6. Extreme Error Correction
Corrects predictions that deviate significantly from the local mean by replacing them with the average of neighboring predictions.

7. Ultra-High Range Tests
Evaluates the performance of the prime generation algorithm in ultra-high numeric ranges (e.g., 
10
15
10 
15
  and 
10
18
10 
18
 ).

8. Execution Time Analysis
Measures and plots the execution time for prime generation across different range sizes.

9. Sensitivity Analysis of Hyperparameters
Assesses the sensitivity of the ML models (RF and GB) to changes in the number of trees, plotting the mean absolute error for different configurations.

10. Experimental Comparison with Deep Learning (LSTM)
Trains and evaluates an LSTM model to correct residual errors from the fractal model, reporting statistical error metrics and plotting an error histogram.

11. Experimental Comparison with Advanced Deep Learning (Transformer)
Defines a Transformer block and trains a Transformer model for error correction using the same data as the LSTM experiment. Compares its performance with the LSTM model through error statistics and histograms.

12. Practical Cryptographic Application: RSA Key Generation
Generates RSA keys using primes extrapolated from the fractal model. It verifies candidate primes and computes RSA parameters (p, q, n, e, d).

13. Main Execution
The main() function orchestrates the sequential execution of all experiments, ensuring that each component is run and the results are displayed.
